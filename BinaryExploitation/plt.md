# Procedure Linkage Table

Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) is used for lazy binding, in which symbol lookups for function calls into shared objects are deferred until the first time a function is actually called.
* Two program sections are used to achieve this effect
    - `.plt` and `.got.plt`
* Lazy binding may be disabled by setting the `LD_BIND_NOW` environment variable to a nonempty string or using the `RTLD_NOW` flag when calling `dlopen()`

## PLT
* Each function stub `push` its `.got.plt` entry's offset, then `jmp` to the head of the `.plt`.
* The `push; jmp` at the head of the `.plt` push the 2nd entry of the `.got.plt`, which is the address of the linkmap head
* Then `jmp` to the 3rd entry: a resolved function named `_dl_runtime_resolve`, which will patch the appropriate function's `.got.plt` entry

## GOT.PLT
* The first 3 entries of `.got.plt` will in all cases be the address of the program's `.dynamic` section, the address of the linkmap head, and the address of `_dl_runtime_resolve`
* All entries after these are functions to be resolved at call time
