# Different File Types
There are three file types created by the Python interpreter when it transforms code into compiled bytecode.
* `.pyc`
* `.pyo`
* `.pyd`

[Complete Version](https://stackabuse.com/differences-between-pyc-pyd-and-pyo-python-files/)

## .pyc
Can be used on any OS

* .pyc is automatically generated by the interpreter when you import a module, which speeds up future importing of that module.
These files are only created from a .py file if it is imported by another .py file or module.
* Using .pyc files only speeds up the loading of your program, not the actual execution of it.
* When the source code file is updated, the .pyc file is updated as well.

## .pyo
Can be used on any OS

* .pyo is also created by the interpreter when a module is imported.
However, it results from running the interpreter when optimization settings are enabled.
* The optimizer is enabled by adding the "-O" flag when we invoke the Python interpreter `python -O <script>`.
* Having the optimizer enabled creates smaller bytecode files. The optimizer, which doesn't do a whole lot,
removes assert statements from your bytecode and speeds up execution.
* `-O0` flag removes both assertion statements and `__doc__` strings

## .pyd
In contrast to the preceding two, it's a platform-specific to Windows

* A .pyd file is a dynamic link library that contains a Python module, or set of modules, to be called by other Python code.
